# Hello-World
My First
This is my first project. Im just learning about "Code" and all this stuff. I become interested shortly after someone secretly screwed my other laptop up by putting all kinds of malware, codes, and I really dont know what exactly but thats what im trying to learn. Anyways, from Hawaii, did some college business classes, tired of building houses that I can't afford to atm in the hot sun. Want to try something new! Any help appreciated! CHEERS!
